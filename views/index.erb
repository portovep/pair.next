      <h3>Tired of keeping your pairing logs on paper? Keep reading.</h3>
      <p>  PairNext is an application designed to help agile teams pair more effectively.  Swapping pairs around on a regular basis helps to ensure that the whole team has a knowledge of the problem domain and the codebase.</p>  
      
      <p>  PairNext keeps track of who has paired with whom over the course of a project and then suggests new pairings endeavouring to match up team members who have paired the least.</p>

      <p>Occasionally it is more beneficial to have two specific team members pair or perhaps keep a particular pair together when all others swap.  PairNext accommodates for this by allowing users to alter the suggested pairings by simply dragging and dropping team members around. </p>
